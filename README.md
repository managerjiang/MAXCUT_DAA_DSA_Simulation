# MAXCUT_DAA_DSA_Simulation
This repository provides distributed synchronous and asynchronous algorithms for large-scale MAXCUT problems. It provides some simple numerical experiments and image segmentation. In addition, comparative tests with centralized method and one existing distributed algorithm are also provided.
