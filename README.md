# MAXCUT_DAA_DSA_Simulation
This repository provides distributed synchronous and asynchronous algorithms for large-scale MAXCUT problems. It provides some simple numerical experiments and image segmentation. In addition, comparative tests with centralized method and one existing distributed algorithm are also provided.
The algorithms are proposed in paper "Distributed synchronous and asynchronous algorithms for semi-definite programming with diagonal constraints" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00360. You can find detailed algorithm description and complete theoretical analysis in the paper.
